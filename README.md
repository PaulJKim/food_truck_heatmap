# FoodTruckHeatmap

This is a liveview app that provides a way to search for and view a heatmap of foodtrucks that are located in San Francisco.

The idea behind this heatmap is to provide insight into where opportunity areas might be for new foodtrucks, or simply
for food truck enthusiasts to know where to find high concentrations of their favorite cuisine.

Currently, the following filters are supported
  1. Search string for food type
  2. Food truck permit status

## Running the application

Start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

## Testing

To run tests:

  * Run `mix test`
